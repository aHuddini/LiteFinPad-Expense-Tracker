## 🚀 Build System Overview

### Current Configuration
```
version.txt (Single Source of Truth)
     ↓
   [3.2]
     ↓
     ├─→ build_latest.bat     → Builds v3.2
     ├─→ build_dev.bat        → Reads v3.2 (can increment to v3.3)
     └─→ build_release.bat    → Reads v3.2 (can increment to v4.0)
```

### Build Scripts Ready
All three build scripts are properly configured:

1. **`build_latest.bat`** (Manual builds)
   - ✅ Reads `version.txt` directly
   - ✅ Currently building: v3.2

2. **`build_dev.bat`** (Development)
   - ✅ Uses `version_manager.py` to read version
   - ✅ Can increment: `build_dev.bat increment` → v3.3
   - ✅ Can rebuild: `build_dev.bat` → v3.2 (same version)

3. **`build_release.bat`** (Production)
   - ✅ Uses `version_manager.py` to read version
   - ✅ Can build stable: `build_release.bat` → v3.2 (optimized)
   - ✅ Can increment: `build_release.bat major` → v4.0
