## 🆕 What's New in v3.5.2

### Critical Threading Fix for Quick Add Dialog (October 2025)

**Critical Fixes:**
- 🐛 **Queue-Based Threading System**: Resolved critical GIL threading issue with Quick Add dialog
  - **Problem**: Tray icon's Win32 message loop runs in background thread; Tkinter is not thread-safe
  - **Solution**: Implemented thread-safe queue system for GUI operations
  - **Impact**: Quick Add dialog now works reliably without threading conflicts or crashes
  - **Technical**: Background thread posts requests to queue; main GUI thread processes them safely
  - **Bonus**: Restored auto-close behavior when clicking outside dialog
  - All test scenarios verified (double-click, add expense, cancel, multiple dialogs, threading stress tests)

**Why This Matters:**
The Quick Add dialog (double-click tray icon) is the fastest way to log expenses. This fix solves a fundamental threading incompatibility between Windows OS interactions (Win32 message loop) and Python's Tkinter GUI framework, ensuring reliable operation on all systems.

## 📋 Recent Updates (v3.5.1)

### Dialog System Refactoring & Logging Optimization

**New Features:**
- 🪟 **Dialog Helper Module**: Centralized dialog creation, positioning, and binding logic
- 🔍 **Debug Mode Toggle**: Optional verbose logging via `settings.ini` for troubleshooting

**Performance Improvements:**
- 📝 **90% Log Reduction**: Comprehensive 3-step logging optimization
  - Mouse movement logs moved to DEBUG level (~99% reduction)
  - Window/click detection simplified (~87% reduction)
  - Export operations streamlined (~75% reduction)
- 🖥️ **Dialog Display Fixes**: Minor UI improvements for better element visibility

**Technical:**
- New `dialog_helpers.py` module with 8 standardized methods
- Intelligent logging system with user-configurable verbosity
- All dialogs except Quick Add (GIL threading) refactored for consistency

**Known Issues:**
- **Quick Add Dialog**: Cannot use standard `DialogHelper` refactoring due to GIL threading requirements (runs in tray icon's background thread)
