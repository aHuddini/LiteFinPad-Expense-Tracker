## INTRODUCTION

Hello World! I'm a beginner to software development and dabbling in the AI-enhanced tech world when I have time to take breaks from my full-time career. 

This is my first "microapp" project coded with the help of Cursor AI (using Claude Sonnet 4 as my primary model of choice). The development framework is a combination of Python (business logic), Tkinter (GUI) & CustomTkinter (GUI).

Inspired to think more seriously about my spending habits from watching Caleb Hammer's Financial Audit YouTube series, I built it for my own personal use to solve a need to quickly keep track of large, monthly expenses (without trying to manage finances on my phone). While it wasn't a one-shot app, I've been learning a lot about software development and how hard it actually is to build software (despite having powerful AI tools to assist me)... I don't know how developers did it before AI tools were a thing. 

I don't know if it will work for everyone else's machines, but I felt my project was stable enough for daily use to release and open source it out for the public.

Check my Beginner_Thoughts.md file for how my AI-assisted development's journey been if you're curious :).

Feedback to improve is welcome!

3. Enter your monthly spending threshold using the number pad or keyboard
4. Click "Set" to save your budget
5. The dashboard will immediately update to show:
   - **Green amount**: How much you're under budget (e.g., "+$500.00")
   - **Red amount**: How much you're over budget (e.g., "-$200.00")
   - **Status**: "(Under)" or "(Over)" indicator
6. Your budget persists across sessions and updates automatically as you add expenses

## Configuration

LiteFinPad uses a `settings.ini` file in the application directory to store user preferences and configuration options. You can edit this file with any text editor to customize the application behavior.

### Location
The `settings.ini` file is located in the same directory as the application executable (or `main.py` if running from source).

### Available Settings

#### Theme Settings
```ini
[Theme]
dark_mode = true    # Enable dark mode (true) or light mode (false)
```

**Dark Mode (Experimental):**
- Set `dark_mode = true` to enable the dark theme
- Set `dark_mode = false` to use the default light theme
- Changes take effect after restarting the application
- Works seamlessly with Archive Mode

#### Budget Settings
```ini
[Budget]
monthly_threshold = 5000.0    # Your monthly spending budget (decimal number)
```

**Monthly Budget:**
- Set your monthly spending threshold as a decimal number
- Can also be set via the Budget Dialog in the application (click "vs. Budget" on dashboard)
- Value persists across sessions

#### Table Settings
```ini
[Table]
sort_column = Date    # Default sort column (Date, Amount, Description)
sort_order = desc     # Sort order (asc or desc)
```

**Table Preferences:**
- `sort_column`: Default column to sort by when viewing expense list
- `sort_order`: Default sort direction (ascending or descending)

#### Export Settings
```ini
[Export]
default_save_location =    # Default folder for exports (leave empty for system default)
```

**Export Preferences:**
- Leave empty to use system default download folder
- Set a custom path to always export to a specific location

#### Logging Settings
```ini
[Logging]
debug_mode = false    # Enable debug logging (true) or disable (false)
```

**Debug Mode:**
- Set `debug_mode = true` for detailed logging (useful for troubleshooting)
- Logs are saved to the `logs/` directory
- Default is `false` for normal operation

#### AutoComplete Settings (Advanced)
```ini
[AutoComplete]
show_on_focus = true      # Show suggestions when field receives focus
min_chars = 2             # Minimum characters before filtering suggestions
max_suggestions = 5        # Maximum suggestions to display
max_descriptions = 50     # Maximum descriptions to track in history
```

**AutoComplete Preferences:**
- Controls behavior of description suggestion dropdown
- Adjust these if you want more/fewer suggestions or different behavior

### Editing Settings

1. Close the application (if running)
2. Open `settings.ini` in any text editor (Notepad, VS Code, etc.)
3. Modify the values as needed
4. Save the file
5. Restart the application for changes to take effect

**Note:** Be careful when editing - invalid values may cause the application to use defaults or fail to start. Always keep a backup of your `settings.ini` file.
