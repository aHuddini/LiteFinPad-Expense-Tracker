## 🎯 **Next Steps - Easy Features Phase**

The next phase focuses on **Easy (⭐⭐)** features that provide high impact with reasonable effort:

### **Priority 1: Keyboard Shortcuts (High Impact)**
1. **B1. Escape Key to Close Dialogs** - 45 min
   - Expected behavior for users
   - Improves workflow significantly
   
2. **B2. Enter Key to Submit Forms** - 30 min
   - Natural form submission
   - Speeds up data entry

### **Priority 2: Data Safety & Information**
3. **B3. Delete Confirmation** - 30 min
   - Prevents accidental data loss
   - Critical for user confidence

4. **B4. About Dialog** - 45 min
   - Professional touch
   - Version and license information

### **Priority 3: Quality of Life**
5. **B5. Window Position Memory** - 60 min (moved to Medium)
   - Remembers window position
   - Multi-monitor support

**Estimated Time for Easy Features**: ~2.5 hours

---

## 🐛 **Known Issues**

### **HIGH PRIORITY: Tray Icon Focus Issue**
- **Status**: Deferred - Requires fundamental architecture investigation
- **Impact**: When window is visible but backgrounded, clicking tray icon hides it instead of bringing to front
- **Workaround**: "Stay on Top" is enabled by default
- **Documentation**: `TRAY_ICON_FOCUS_ISSUE.md` contains detailed investigation roadmap
- **Future Fix**: May require:
  - Architecture review (Tkinter vs. PyQt/wxPython)
  - Tray icon implementation changes
  - Event-driven approach instead of polling
  - Advanced Windows API integration

## 🎨 **Design Philosophy for v3.0**

### **Core Principles**
1. **High Impact First** - Prioritize features users will notice and appreciate
2. **Low Effort First** - Build momentum with quick wins
3. **User Experience** - Every feature should improve daily use
4. **Maintainability** - Keep code clean and well-documented
5. **Size Conscious** - Maintain ~23 MB distribution size
6. **Offline First** - No cloud dependencies

### **Feature Selection Criteria**
- ✅ Does it improve daily workflow?
- ✅ Is it intuitive and expected behavior?
- ✅ Can it be implemented reliably?
- ✅ Does it align with the app's philosophy?
- ❌ Does it add unnecessary complexity?
- ❌ Does it require large dependencies?
