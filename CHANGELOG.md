### 🐛 **Critical Bug Fixes**

#### **Tkinter Validation Event Loop Deadlock** 🔧 FIXED
- **Fixed**: Application freeze when using pre-filled Entry widgets with validation
  - **Root Cause**: Pre-filled Entry widgets (`StringVar(value="3000.00")`) created validation state conflict
  - **Symptom**: Clicking "OK" in budget dialog froze entire application (no error logs)
  - **Solution**: Blank entry field + separate display label pattern
    - Entry starts blank (`StringVar(value="")`) - no validation conflicts
    - Current budget displayed as read-only label above entry
    - Numpad works correctly with blank entry (append-only logic)
  - **Impact**: Budget dialog now works reliably without freezing
  - **Documented**: Added to `AI_REFERENCE_TECH.md` as critical Tkinter gotcha

#### **Settings Manager Threading Fix** 🔧 FIXED
- **Fixed**: Lock-within-lock deadlock in `settings_manager.py`
  - `set()` method was calling `save()` while already holding lock
  - Created internal `_save_unlocked()` method to prevent deadlock
  - Auto-save now uses unlocked version when lock is already held

#### **Week Progress Display Fix** 🔧 FIXED
- **Fixed**: Week value displaying beyond calculated total (e.g., "5.2/5" in 5-week month)
  - Modified `calculate_week_progress()` to cap `precise_week` at `total_weeks`
  - Ensures display is logically capped until next month

#### **Budget Display Update Fix** 🔧 FIXED (November 3, 2025)
- **Fixed**: "vs. Budget" metric not updating after setting/changing budget
  - **Symptom**: Budget could be saved but "vs. Budget" display would not refresh until application restart
  - **Root Causes**:
    1. Budget label widgets were not extracted as instance attributes, so update method couldn't access them
    2. Used `text_color` attribute (CTkLabel) instead of `foreground` (ttk.Label)
    3. Used `monthly_total` (all expenses) instead of `monthly_total_past` (past expenses only)
  - **Solution**: 
    - Added widget extraction for `budget_amount_label` and `budget_status_label`
    - Fixed widget attribute to use `foreground` for ttk.Label
    - Updated calculation to use `ExpenseDataManager.calculate_monthly_total()` for consistency
    - Display now updates immediately after budget changes
  - **Impact**: Budget feature now fully functional with real-time display updates

#### **Archive Mode Bug Fixes** 🔧 FIXED (November 8, 2025)
- **Fixed**: Multiple critical issues preventing archive mode from working correctly
  - **Problems Fixed**:
    1. Archive mode colors not updating when switching months
    2. Display values (total, count, progress, analytics) not updating in archive mode
    3. "+Add Expense" button not disabling in archive mode
    4. CustomTkinter widget compatibility errors (using `style` parameter incorrectly)
    5. Tooltip duplication and persistence issues
  - **Root Causes**:
    1. Widget type detection wasn't properly identifying CustomTkinter vs ttk widgets
    2. `main_container` frame wasn't being updated for archive mode
    3. Using `.config()` instead of `.configure()` for CustomTkinter buttons
    4. Tooltip event handlers accumulating without proper cleanup
    5. `update_display()` using incorrect expense filtering for archive mode
  - **Solutions Applied**:
    - Added `main_container` parameter to ArchiveModeManager for complete frame updates
    - Improved widget detection using `isinstance()` and `hasattr('fg_color')` checks
    - Fixed CustomTkinter button state management (use `.configure()` not `.config()`)
    - Fixed `update_display()` to show ALL expenses in archive mode (no date filtering)
    - Fixed tooltip_manager to unbind old handlers before binding new ones
    - Added proper tooltip cleanup in archive mode transitions
    - Fixed expense filtering for analytics calculations in archive mode
  - **Files Modified**: `archive_mode_manager.py`, `gui.py`, `quick_add_helper.py`, `tooltip_manager.py`
  - **Impact**: Archive mode now fully functional with correct colors, values, button states, and tooltips

---

### 🔧 **Code Quality Improvements**

#### **Analytics Method Consolidation** 🔧 NEW (November 8, 2025)
- **Improved**: Eliminated duplicate expense filtering logic across analytics methods
  - **Problem**: Same filtering patterns repeated in 5 different methods (`calculate_daily_average`, `calculate_weekly_average`, `calculate_weekly_pace`, `calculate_median_expense`, `calculate_largest_expense`)
  - **Solution**: Created 4 reusable helper methods to centralize filtering logic:
    - `_filter_expenses_by_date_range()` - Generic date range filtering
    - `_filter_expenses_by_month()` - Month-specific filtering
    - `_filter_expenses_by_week()` - Week-specific filtering
    - `_filter_past_expenses()` - Simple past-only filtering
  - **Benefits**:
    - Single source of truth for filtering logic
    - Easier maintenance (fix bugs once instead of multiple places)
    - Better code organization and consistency
    - No breaking changes (all public APIs unchanged)
  - **Files Modified**: `analytics.py` - Added helper methods, refactored 5 calculation methods
  - **Impact**: Improved code maintainability, foundation for future analytics enhancements

#### **Data Loading Exception Handling** 🔧 NEW (November 9, 2025)
- **Improved**: Narrowed exception handling in data loading/saving operations for better error diagnostics
  - **Problem**: Broad `Exception` catches in `ExpenseDataManager.load_expenses()` and `save_expenses()` made it difficult to diagnose specific issues (JSON errors vs permission errors vs system errors)
  - **Solution**: Replaced broad exception handling with specific exception types:
    - `load_expenses()`: Now catches `FileNotFoundError`, `json.JSONDecodeError`, `PermissionError`, `OSError` specifically before fallback
    - `save_expenses()`: Now catches `PermissionError`, `OSError` specifically before fallback
  - **Benefits**:
    - More specific error messages for users (e.g., "Invalid JSON format" vs "Permission denied")
    - Better error diagnostics in logs (specific exception types logged)
    - Easier debugging (identify root cause faster)
    - Consistent with exception handling refactoring patterns
  - **Files Modified**: `data_manager.py` - Narrowed exception handling in 2 methods
  - **Impact**: Improved error reporting and debugging capabilities

#### **Exception Handling Refactoring** 🔧 NEW (November 8, 2025)
- **Phase 1: Documentation** - Added comprehensive comments explaining framework workarounds
  - Documented Windows OS requirements for window procedures (must catch all exceptions)
  - Explained Tkinter limitations requiring defensive programming
  - Clarified PyInstaller detection as standard pattern (not workaround)
  - Added comments to 11 locations across `tray_icon.py`, `main.py`, and `window_manager.py`
  - **Impact**: Future developers understand why broad exceptions are necessary

- **Phase 2: Narrowing Exceptions** - Improved error detection with specific exception handling
  - Icon loading: Catches `WindowsError`/`OSError`/`AttributeError` specifically, then fallback
  - Window creation: Catches Win32 errors specifically, then fallback
  - Dialog cleanup: Catches `tk.TclError`/`AttributeError` specifically, then fallback
  - GUI queue shutdown: Catches `tk.TclError`/`AttributeError`/`RuntimeError` specifically, then fallback
  - Window operations: Catches Tkinter errors specifically, then fallback
  - **Impact**: Better error categorization (DEBUG for expected, ERROR/WARNING for unexpected)
  - **Files Updated**: `tray_icon.py` (2 locations), `main.py` (2 locations), `window_manager.py` (4 locations)

- **Phase 3: Win32 Decorator Pattern** - Reduced code duplication in Win32 API error handling
  - Created `@win32_safe` decorator for reusable Win32 exception handling
  - Applied to 5 methods: `create_window()`, `add_to_tray()`, `update_tooltip()`, `remove_from_tray()`, `show_context_menu()`
  - Catches Win32-specific exceptions (`WindowsError`, `OSError`, `AttributeError`) with configurable defaults
  - Reduced ~20 lines of duplicate exception handling code
  - **Impact**: DRY principle applied, improved maintainability, functionality preserved
  - **Files Updated**: `tray_icon.py`

- **Testing**: ✅ All phases tested and verified working correctly
- **Documentation**: Created `CODEBASE_STYLE_PROFILE.md`, `REFACTORING_PLAN.md`, and `REFACTORING_COMPLETE_SUMMARY.md`

#### **Defensive Checks Analysis & Removal** 📊 NEW (November 2, 2025)
- **Analyzed**: 28 `hasattr()` checks across 9 files
  - ✅ 22 NECESSARY (79%) - Legitimate runtime checks (tooltip management, PyInstaller detection, platform-specific handling, initialization safety)
  - ⚠️ 3 REMOVABLE (10%) - Obvious defensive code (remaining in `gui.py`, low priority)
  - ✅ 4 REMOVED (14%) - Successfully cleaned up unnecessary checks
- **Removed**: 4 unnecessary defensive checks
  - `main.py` line 716: `status_manager` check in `export_expenses_dialog()`
  - `main.py` line 726: `status_manager` check in `import_expenses_dialog()`
  - `window_manager.py` line 170: `stay_on_top_var` check in `toggle_stay_on_top()`
  - `window_manager.py` line 178: `stay_on_top_var` check in `_apply_topmost_setting()`
- **Verified**: `archive_mode_manager` checks in `gui.py` are NECESSARY
  - Attempted removal caused `AttributeError` during startup
  - Methods called during early initialization before manager exists
  - Checks re-introduced for stability
- **Impact**: Cleaner code, zero functional changes, thoroughly tested
- **Documented**: See `docs/internal/DEFENSIVE_CHECKS_ANALYSIS.md` for complete analysis

#### **Settings Manager Module** ⚙️ NEW
- **Created**: `settings_manager.py` - Centralized settings management system
